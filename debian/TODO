Here are the parts missing in this package.

Critical stuff
==============

This shouldn't be used or published until this is fixed.

 * (nil)

Debian policy compliance issues
===============================

 * comply with the FHS by not installing in /var/aegir (that is the
   sole litian override we have)

   the proper way to do this is to follow the webapps policies:
   http://webapps-common.alioth.debian.org/draft/html/

 * respect the PHP policy:
   http://webapps-common.alioth.debian.org/draft-php/html/

 * do not duplicate code with Drupal, to respect section 4.13 of the
   policy: "Debian packages should not make use of these [...] copies
   unless the included package is explicitly intended to be used in
   this way. If the included code is already in the Debian archive in
   the form of a library, the Debian packaging should ensure that
   binary packages reference the libraries already in Debian and the
   convenience copy is not used. If the included code is not already
   in Debian, it should be packaged separately as a prerequisite if
   possible." The main reason for this is that "Having multiple copies
   of the same code in Debian is inefficient, often creates either
   static linking or shared library conflicts, and, most importantly,
   increases the difficulty of handling security vulnerabilities in
   the duplicated code."
 
Nice to have stuff
==================

 * deal with /var/aegir after purge?
 * use a minimal rules file:
   /usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/rules.tiny
 * sign the md5s of hostmaster and friends so we have a trust path in
   the packaging again
