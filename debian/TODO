Critical stuff

This shouldn't be used or published until this is fixed.

 * (nil)

Nice to have stuff
==================

 * destroy a platform after upgrading it (make sure it's empty!)
 * deal with /var/aegir after purge?
 * warn the user if #includedir not set in sudo
 * comply with the FHS
 * use a minimal rules file:
   /usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/rules.tiny
 * do not duplicate code with Drupal (so that we're policy compliant,
   probably impossible)
 * review and respect the webapps policies:
   http://webapps-common.alioth.debian.org/draft/html/
