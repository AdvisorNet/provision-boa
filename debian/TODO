Here are the parts missing in this package.

Critical stuff
==============

This shouldn't be used or published until this is fixed.

 * (nil)

Nice to have stuff
==================

 * make a separate package for hostmaster that installs the frontend
 * deal with /var/aegir after purge?
 * comply with the FHS
 * use a minimal rules file:
   /usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/rules.tiny
 * do not duplicate code with Drupal (so that we're policy compliant,
   probably impossible)
 * review and respect the webapps policies:
   http://webapps-common.alioth.debian.org/draft/html/
