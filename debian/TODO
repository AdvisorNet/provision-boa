Here are the parts missing from this package:

 1. create the aegir user (done)
 2. setup sudo (mostly done: need to warn the user if #includedir not
    set)
 3. setup the file infrastructure (done)
 4. hook into the apache config: (done)
   Include /var/aegir/config/vhost.d
 5. create a database superuser:
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username_here'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   this needs to be done with db-common thingy
 6. those settings need to be written to the system-wide drushrc:
   * mysql creds
   * config and backup paths (done)
   * apache restart commands (done)
   * user and group settings (done)
 7. find a proper place for the documentation below.

Some of that code is already available in install.sh.txt in hostmaster
HEAD.
