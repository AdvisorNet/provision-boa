aegir-provision for Debian
--------------------------

This is part of the Aegir suite. This package takes care of installing
the provision file in the proper location so it's seen by Drush and sets
up some directories and the aegir user. See the INSTALL.txt in the
hostmaster project for install instructions:

http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster

The directories, under Debian, are:

 Platforms and Aegir home: /var/lib/aegir
 Backups: /var/backups/aegir
 Configs: /etc/aegir

All those directories should be owned by the webserver user. You will
need to enter those paths in the install wizard when setting up the
platforms and frontend.
